Asteroids sample demonstrates multi-threaded rendering of large number of random-generated asteroid meshes 
with [Methane Kit](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit) library with graphics API and platform independent implementation,
which is based on DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal.
Thousands of unique asteroid instances (1000-50000) are drawn with individual Draw-calls in parallel with a random combination of:
- random-generated mesh (from array of up to 1000 unique meshes)
- random generated perlin-noise array texture each with 3 projections (from array of up to 50 unique textures)
- random combination of coloring (from 72 color combinations)

Methane Asteroids sample was inspired by [Intel Asteroids D3D12](https://github.com/GameTechDev/asteroids_d3d12),
but implemented from scratch in a cross-platform style using [Methane Kit](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit).

## Features

Default parameters of asteroids simulation are selected depending on CPU HW cores count and are displayed 
in right-bottom panel (switched with `F3` key).
Overall scene complexity can be reduced or increased by pressing `[` / `]` keys.
Sample renders galaxy background using [Methane::Graphics::SkyBox](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit/tree/master/Modules/Graphics/Extensions/Include/Methane/Graphics/SkyBox.h)
and planet using generated [Methane::Graphics::SphereMesh](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit/tree/master/Modules/Graphics/Primitives/Include/Methane/Graphics/Mesh/SphereMesh.hpp)
with spherical texture coordinates. It also uses interactive [Arc-Ball camera](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit/tree/master/Modules/Graphics/Camera/Include/Methane/Graphics/ArcBallCamera.h)
rotated with mouse `LMB` and light rotated with `RMB` with keyboard shortcuts also available (see in help by `F1` key).

## Application Controller 

Keyboard actions are enabled with [AsteroidsAppController](/App/AsteroidsAppController.h) 
derived from [Methane::Platform::Keyboard::ActionControllerBase](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit/tree/master/Modules/Platform/Input/Include/Methane/Platform/KeyboardActionControllerBase.hpp):

| Asteroids App Action         | Keyboard Shortcut   |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Switch Parallel Rendering    | `P`                 |
| Switch Mesh LODs Coloring    | `L`                 |
| Increase Mesh LOD Complexity | `'`                 |
| Decrease Mesh LOD Complexity | `;`                 |
| Increase Scene Complexity    | `]`                 |
| Decrease Scene Complexity    | `[`                 |
| Set Scene Complexity 0 .. 9  | `0..9`              |

## Optimizations

Sample includes the following optimizations and features:
- Asteroid meshes use **dynamically selected LODs** depending on estimated screen size.
This allows to greatly reduce GPU overhead. Use `L` key to enable LODs coloring and `'` / `;` keys to increase / reduce overall mesh level of details.
- **Parallel rendering** of asteroids array with individual draw-calls allows to be less CPU bound.
Multi-threading can be switched off for comparing with single-threaded rendering by pressing `P` key.
- **Parallel updating** of asteroid transformation matrices in [AsteroidsArray::Update](/Modules/Simulation/AsteroidsArray.cpp#L352) and 
encoding asteroid meshes rendering in [MeshBuffers::DrawParallel](https://github.com/MethanePowered/MethaneKit/tree/master/Modules/Graphics/Extensions/Include/Methane/Graphics/MeshBuffers.hpp#L160)
are implemented using [Taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow/) library which enables effective usage of the thread-pool via `parallel_for` primitive.
- All asteroid textures are bound to program uniform all at once as an **array of textures** to minimize number of program binding calls between draws.
Particular texture is selected on each draw call using index parameter in constants buffer.
Note that each asteroid texture is a texture 2d array itself with 3 mip-mapped textures used for triplane projection.
- **Inverted depth buffer** (with values from 1 in foreground to 0 in background and greater-or-equal compare function)
is used to minimize frame buffer overdrawing by rendering in order from foreground to background: asteroids array with planet
are drawn first and sky-box afterwards.
